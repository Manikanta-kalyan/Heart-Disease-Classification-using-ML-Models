## Heart-Disease-Classification-using-ML-Models ##
* Cleaned the raw heart diseases related data using python scripts and analysed the cleaned data using bar,pair plots and graphs for input feature selection. 
* Built Machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBooster to predict whether a person will have heart disease or not * * Based on accuracy and different model parameters choose the best performing model which is SVM with 90% accuracy.
* More detailed analysis about each model is present in the reports section above.
